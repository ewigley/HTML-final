	<h4>I used some work and input from other people on the different websites to complete this project. In agreement with thier request to use their work they needed to be referrenced in some way. This page, while I understand wouldn't actually be part of this website in real life, I wanted to have their work travel with this project. Especially since I forked this project on Repl.it</h4>
	<h4>This page details the use of different elements in my project. For the Pexels pictures I used their content rights information to get the photographer's information. Pexels didn't require a direct link back their site according to their fair use. Any other content used didn't say specifically if a direct link was required, however I did to be safe with fair use.</h4>
	<h4> Please be aware this page has it's own .css linked in the html of the page. This is because I wanted a very clear cut black and white formate with the citations. </h4>

	<dt>Website Design</dt>
	<dd>Initial design was made by <a href="https://replit.com/@lilykhan">Lilykhan</a>. Some Javascript was also completed by <a href="https://replit.com/@apoorvsingal">Apoorvsingal</a>.</dd>
	<dd>&emsp;- The rest of the editing was done by myself. The creator Lilykhan stated in the readonly file they required only for the user to add a new fork on the site, so the creator can see the creations from the original project. This was completed and the original owner was notified of my use.</dd>
	<dd>&emsp;- The fork to the project can be found at <a href="https://replit.com/@lilykhan/Portfolio-Site-Template">Lilykhan's Published Template.</a>
	<h4>The following photos were taken from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> Each photo was checked for fair use. If the photographer requested to be notified before use, this action was completed before use of their photo(s) was used in this project.</h4>
